# Wake-word-detection-
Wake word detection using open wakeword
This is a real-time wake word detection app built with **Streamlit**, using the [openWakeWord](https://github.com/dersimn/openWakeWord) library for ONNX-based inference. The app listens to microphone input and alerts you when a specific wake word is detected, playing a sound and updating the UI.

Designed for prototyping and demonstration, itâ€™s ideal for voice interface projects, smart assistants, or offline voice-triggered actions on the edge.

Just select a model, click **Start Listening**, and say the wake word!
